       <p>
        I joined Alt school Africa to enhance my knoweldge in writing testable<br>

       so i can share knowledge together<br> with them and also learn from them. ALTSCHOOLS Africa gives 
       <br>good community support and learning flexibility.
       with Altschool<br> I have the flexibility to learned while still going about my normal<br>
       duty that is why I prefer Altschool to other options that I had.
