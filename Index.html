        <h2>The reason why I joined Altschool</h2>
        The fact that I have so much passion and interest for software
        development,<br> With my years of experiencein construction and electrical engineering
        field which<br> it involed designing, constructing and making a building
        functional for man's use. <br>Software and Web Technology also involve structural language(HTML)
        layout <br>for design(CSS) and a language for making the web functional(JavaScript).<br>
        So i knew that i will do well because of my idea of construction work.<br>
        I decided to transition into Tech proper where i can learn
        and gain<br> more knowledge in software development and hands-on- practicals<br>
        on coding and to be exposed to and learn new tech tools, I want<br> to relate with my school mate
        so i can share knowledge together<br> with them and also learn from them. ALTSCHOOLS Africa
        can give<br> me the flexibility to learned while still going about my normal<br>
        duty that is why i prefer Altschool to other options that i had.
